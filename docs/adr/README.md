# About ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

This directory contains our Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a short document that captures a single, significant architectural decision made during the development of our project. Each ADR describes the context of the decision, the options considered, the decision itself, and its consequences.

## Why do we use ADRs?

1.  **Clarity & Consistency**: They provide a clear rationale for our architectural choices, ensuring everyone on the team understands the "why" behind the "what."
2.  **Onboarding**: New team members can read through the ADRs to quickly understand the project's technical history and key design principles.
3.  **Future-Proofing**: They prevent "architecture amnesia," where we forget the reasons for past decisions, leading to repeated debates or mistakes.
4.  **Accountability**: They document the decision-making process.

## Format

Each ADR should be a separate Markdown file in this directory, named using the pattern `NNN-short-title.md`, where `NNN` is a sequential number (e.g., `001-use-adr-for-decision-logging.md`).

We will use a simple template for our ADRs, focusing on:

*   **Title**: A short, descriptive title.
*   **Status**: (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated)
*   **Context**: The problem or situation that requires a decision.
*   **Decision**: The solution we chose.
*   **Consequences**: The positive and negative results of the decision.

By maintaining these records, we build a robust, well-documented, and maintainable project.
