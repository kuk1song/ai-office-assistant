# 001: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Decision Logging

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

Our project documentation was evolving. We had an `ERROR_LOG.md` file that captured bugs and solutions, but we needed a more structured way to record significant decisions, not just bug fixes. As the project grows, relying on a single, long log file becomes unmanageable, and we risk losing the "why" behind our key technical choices. We needed a system that was scalable, easy to search, and provided clear context for future developers (including our future selves and AI assistants).

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** methodology for logging all significant architectural and technical decisions.

This involves:
1.  Creating a new directory at `docs/adr/`.
2.  Each significant decision will be documented in its own Markdown file within this directory.
3.  Files will be named with a sequential number and a short, descriptive title in kebab-case (e.g., `002-adopt-kebab-case-for-filenames.md`).
4.  The `ERROR_LOG.md` file will be deprecated and its relevant historical content will be migrated into individual ADRs.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved Clarity**: Each decision is atomic, well-defined, and easy to find and understand.
- **Enhanced Onboarding**: New contributors can review the ADRs to rapidly understand the project's technical evolution.
- **Better Context for AI**: Provides structured, high-quality context for AI assistants, enabling them to understand our rationale and make better suggestions.
- **Scalability**: The system can handle hundreds of decisions without becoming cluttered.

### Negative
- **Slight Overhead**: There is a small initial effort required to create a new file and follow the format for each decision. However, this is considered a worthwhile investment.
